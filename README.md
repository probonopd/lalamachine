# lalamachine

## Intro

lalamachine is a rhythmbox clone. I like rhythmbox a lot, but it is missing
certain features, like sorting playlists. On the other hand it has so many
features I never use. It is also the only Gnome application I use.

## Dependencies

lalamachine is a Qt5 application and uses QtMultimedia to play music.
The only other (direct) dependency is taglib.
Since QtMultimedia uses GStreamer as backend you probably want to install
GStreamer codecs.
